## Project Description

GourmetStay Finder is a visualization tool designed to help food-travelers find Airbnb listings near popular food hotspots in New York City. The tool was developed by following Tamara Munzner's nested model, ensuring a structured approach to visualization design.

> ⚠️ This project was created for the course Visualisation at Eindhoven University of Technology. It was an elective for the Authors in the Bachelor's program Mechanical Engineering. The project was created for this course and is not intended for commercial use and was build quickly to conform to the deadline and thus may contain bugs and unclean code. ⚠️

### Key Features

- **Data Collection and Cleaning**: Datasets for restaurants and Airbnb listings in New York were gathered, analyzed, and cleaned to ensure accuracy and relevance.
- **Data Abstraction**: The data was abstracted to identify key attributes and relationships, facilitating meaningful visualizations.
- **Task Identification**: Multiple tasks for the visualization were identified to ensure the tool meets the needs of food-travelers.
- **Layout Brainstorming**: Various layout options for the InfoVis tool were brainstormed and discussed, leading to the creation of the final product.
- **Original Contributions**: Despite being based on other scientific InfoVis studies, this tool introduces original contributions by creating compact multiple views where quantitative and categorical attributes can be filtered to achieve users' goals.
- **Multiple Views and Filtering**: The tool integrates different multiple views along with filtering and multivariate idioms into a single comprehensive tool, making it the first of its kind.

This study serves as an initial investigation into how different multiple views, filtering, and multivariate idioms can interconnect into a single comprehensive tool, providing valuable insights for future research and development in the field of information visualization.
